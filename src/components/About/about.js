                    <p>
                        I am currently a masterâ€™s student at the University of Washington studying computer science with an emphasis on machine learning. 
                        I am passionate about software development, data analysis, cloud development, and enjoy seeing a product through its full development cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my academic achievements, I have been a leader in several clubs such as the Asian American Association, Assocation of Computing Machinery, and LEAD Peer Tutoring. 
                        I also worked as a manager at a restaurant where I have developed strong leadership skills and a strong work ethic. 
                        Through my hard work, I was able to land multiple internships revolving around software development and working with clients and stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing and watching a variety of sports such as basketball, football, soccer, golf, and mixed martial arts. 
                        I believe sports have taught me valuable skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, which have helped me in both my academic and professional life.
